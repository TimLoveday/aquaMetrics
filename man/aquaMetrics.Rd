This package contains several functions which compute multiple ecological 
metrics at different Taxonomic Levels (TL) using multiple season combinations.
\itemize{
 \item SPEAR (\code{\link{CalcSPEAR}})\cr Species at Risk
 \item PSI (\code{\link{CalcPSI}})\cr Proportion of Sediment-sensitive Invertebrates
 \item LIFE (\code{\link{CalcLIFE}})\cr Lotic Invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation
 \item Riverfly's ASI (\code{\link{CalcASI}})\cr Riverfly Angler's Score Index
 \item Climate Change (\code{\link{CalcCC}})\cr Climate Change. Thermal indicator. 
 \item DARLEQ (\code{\link{CalcDARLEQ}})\cr Diatoms for Assessing River and Lake Ecological Quality
}

Taxonomic Levels are the different output options developed by RIVAPCS
to produce results at both species and family levels:\cr
TL1 - BMWP families\cr
TL2 - Revised BMWP (WHPT) families\cr
TL3 - All families\cr
TL4 - RIVPACS species\cr
TL5 - WFD species

Season codes define different season combinations used to calculate the 
indices, those are listed below:\cr
\samp{1} = spring\cr
\samp{2} = summer\cr
\samp{3} = autumn\cr
\samp{4} = spring + summer\cr
\samp{5} = spring + autumn\cr
\samp{6} = summer + autumn\cr
\samp{7} = spring + summer + autumn

There is also a common routine (\code{\link{StandardiseRawTaxa}}) which should 
be run prior to any calculation in order to standardise taxa counts into the 
required Taxonomic Levels.
